# "Todo" Assigment

Create a TODO app following the basic [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) principles (Create, Read, Update & delete)

- C: It should be possible to create a list of task from an text input
- R: Able to read and display them in a nice looking list
- U: Be able to update what task have been completed
- D: You should be able to delete what isn't needed anymore

Then you should upload this to GitHub and send it in, preferable with a nice commit history of all the stuff you do.
